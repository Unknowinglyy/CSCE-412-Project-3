# CSCE-412-Project-3
C++ Load Balancer

This repository houses my work for Project 3 of CSCE 412. Overall, I was tasked with creating a load balancer in C++ with some supporting classes to prove my implementation was done correctly.

I used AI for certain small functions contained in the supporting classes (request, webserver, and load balancer) and designed the overall structure of the program myself.

A Makefile was used to compile this project. To compile, use the `make` command. After that, to execute, write `./load`
